We can fix anything. Let's make a nice big leafy tree. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. This is the way you take out your flustrations. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. Only eight colors that you need. Happy painting, God bless. Don't be bashful drop me a line. In your world you have total and absolute power. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. Brown is such a nice color. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. It is a lot of fun. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako.
